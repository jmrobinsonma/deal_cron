# This is a terminal app that will scrape Craigslist
# and send an email with the results. This app uses
# argparse and requires a minimum of three commandline
# arguments.
#
# Example:
# $ python3 dealcron.py free-stuff email@emailaddress.com -u 'https://westernmass.craigslist.org/search/zip?hasPic=1'
#
# The first argument is a short name for the results 
# message and database. Second argument is an email 
# address to send results to. For the third argument 
# at least one craigslist url must be entered. For best results
# I suggest applying filters on the Craigslist page so that url
# contains the most accurate search criteria. Each 
# url must be flagged -u and be in single quotes following a whitespace
#
# Example:
# -u 'http://*/*'
#
# An example of when i would use multiple url's is if I was 
# looking for a clothes washing machine and dryer. I'd use one url to
# search for "washing machine", another to search "dryer", and
# a third url to search "washer and dryer"
